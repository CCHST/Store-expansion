## Store Expansion Project

In this project, we utilized DBSCAN and K-means algorithms to analyze order addresses and determine optimal locations for opening new stores. By clustering order data, we identified strategic areas that efficiently manage order volumes within each store's coverage. This data-driven approach not only enhances operational efficiency but also improves customer satisfaction by ensuring timely and effective service delivery.

### Key Highlights:
- Applied DBSCAN and K-means algorithms for clustering.
- Identified strategic locations for new store openings based on order data analysis.
- Optimized order volume distribution to improve operational efficiency.
- Enhanced customer satisfaction through timely service delivery.

This project demonstrates our commitment to leveraging data analytics to drive strategic business decisions and expand our market presence effectively.
